üîç Intuition
The goal is to make all numbers in the array greater than or equal to k by performing a merge operation:

    - Pick the two smallest numbers.
    - Create a new number:
        * 2√ómin(first,second)+max(first,second)
    - Repeat until the smallest number is at least k.

Since we always merge the two smallest numbers, a Min-Heap (PriorityQueue) is the optimal data structure for this task.

üí° Approach
Step 1: Use a Min-Heap (PriorityQueue):
    - Insert all elements from nums into the heap.

Step 2. Iterate until the smallest element is ‚â• k:
    - Poll the two smallest numbers (first and second).
    - Compute the new number:
        * newNum=2√ómin(first,second)+max(first,second)
    - Push the new number back into the heap.
    - Increment count (cnt) for each merge operation.

Step 3. Return the number of operations needed to reach k.

‚è±Ô∏è Complexity
Time Complexity:
    - O(N log N) : Due to heap operations (each insertion and deletion takes O(logn)).

Space Complexity:
    - O(N) : For storing elements in the priority queue.
