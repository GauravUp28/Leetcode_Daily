/*
üîç Intuition
The problem requires compressing an array of characters using Run-Length Encoding (RLE).
Instead of storing consecutive duplicate characters separately, we replace them with a single occurrence of the character followed by its count (if more than one).
This reduces the space used for redundant characters while maintaining the original order.

üí° Approach
1. Use Two Pointers:
    a. i: Traverses the input array.
    b. res: Keeps track of where to write in the modified chars array.

2. Count Consecutive Duplicates:
    a. Start at index i, count the number of repeated occurrences (len).
    b. Move i forward by len.

3. Write the Compressed Output:
    a. Always store the character chars[i] at chars[res].
    b. If len > 1, convert the count (len) into characters and store each digit in chars[].

4. Return the final compressed length (res).

‚è±Ô∏è Complexity
Time Complexity:
O(N) (Single pass through the array)

Space Complexity:
O(1) (In-place modification, no extra space used)

            // Count the number of consecutive repeating characters

                for (char c : Integer.toString(len).toCharArray()) { // Convert length to char array
