üîç Intuition
The problem requires us to find days when:
    - The security count is non-increasing for time days before the current day.
    - The security count is non-decreasing for time days after the current day.

For the input security = [5, 3, 3, 3, 5, 6, 2] and time = 2, we need to identify days when:
    - The security count is non-increasing for 2 days before the current day.
    - The security count is non-decreasing for 2 days after the current day.

üí° Approach
Step 1: Compute nonIncrease Array
    - This array tracks the number of consecutive days before the current day when the security count is non-increasing.
    - Iterate through the security array from left to right.

Step 2: Compute nonDecrease Array
    - This array tracks the number of consecutive days after the current day when the security count is non-decreasing.
    - Iterate through the security array from right to left.

Step 3: Find Good Days
    - For each day, check if:
        * nonIncrease[i] >= time (non-increasing for time days before).
        * nonDecrease[i] >= time (non-decreasing for time days after).
    - If both conditions are satisfied, add the day to the result list.

‚è±Ô∏è Complexity
Time Complexity:
    - O(n): We iterate through the security array three times (once for nonIncrease, once for nonDecrease, and once to find good days).

Space Complexity:
    - O(n): We use two auxiliary arrays (nonIncrease and nonDecrease) of size n.
